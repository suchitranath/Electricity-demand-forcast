## AI-Driven Electricity Demand Forecasting System
An intelligent forecasting system that predicts electricity demand using ML, deep learning, and federated learning for improved grid planning and stability.

## About
The AI-Driven Electricity Demand Forecasting System is designed to predict future electricity consumption using advanced Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Federated Learning techniques. Traditional load forecasting methods struggle with non-linear patterns, seasonal variation, climate changes, and regional differences. This project solves these challenges by integrating an intelligent forecasting model that uses historical load data, weather features, and temporal attributes to generate highly accurate predictions.

The system enhances grid stability, supports decision-making for power utilities, reduces demand-supply imbalance, and enables scalable, privacy-preserving model training through federated learning. It is capable of real-time forecasting and performs exceptionally well in scenarios with fluctuating climate conditions and diverse regional load profiles.
## Features
- Utilizes LSTM-based deep learning models for high-accuracy time-series forecasting.
- Integrates Federated Learning for privacy-preserving collaborative model training across regions.
- Handles weather, socio-economic, and temporal variables for more realistic demand prediction.
- Lightweight and scalable framework suitable for deployment on cloud or edge environments.
- Performs preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction automatically.
- Provides visual outputs such as graphs for training performance and actual vs predicted loads.
- Minimal computational complexity due to optimized architecture and streamlined preprocessing.
